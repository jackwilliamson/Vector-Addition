# Vector-Addition

Takes a list of inputted vectors of format 10.0m[N45.0E] and outputs the resulting total vector of all the vectors added together.
Units are not required, but need to be consistent
Negative numbers are allowed for the distance, but not for the angle.


# TODO
Allow negative angles
Error checking on units


# Usage

1. Create a jar file from code (ex. VectorAddition.jar)
2. Open cmd (Command Prompt)
3. Go to directory holding VectorAddition.jar
4. Type `java -jar VectorDisplacement.jar`
5. Enter list of vectors, one per line
6. Enter the word `done` when finished inputting vectors
7. Resulting vector is printed
